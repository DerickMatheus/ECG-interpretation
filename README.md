# ECG-interpretation
<h2> How To Run </h2>

<h4> Downloading Data </h4>
On the "data" folder, you'll find a file named "get_data.sh". Run <i>sh get_data.sh</i> on your terminal and all
the data will be downloaded and extracted.

<h4> Matching the Requirements </h4>
On the main folder, there's a file called "requirements.yml". Create a Conda Environment from that file and you
should be ready to go. <br/>
Further instructions can be found in the link below: <br/>
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html.

<h4> Running the Code </h4>

In the main folder, go for <i>python run.py</i> on your terminal and you'll run the code with default values.
The default values are as follows:

<br/><i>
val_traces = 'data/ecg_tracings.hdf5' <br/>
model  = 'data/model.hdf5' <br/>
real   = None <br/>
noise  = None <br/>
sim    = 100 <br/>
id_ecg = "all" <br/>
</i>

To run with values other than the default, you can type:<br/>
<i>python run.py with 'a=value1' 'b="value2"' 'c=value3'</i>

For example, to run for id_ecg = 1, number of simulations = 50 and another dataset, you would do: <br/>
<i>python run.py with 'id_ecg=1' 'sim=100' 'val_traces="path/to/dataset.hdf5"'</i> <br/>
<br/>

<h2> Code Output </h2>

<h4> Graphs </h4>

A graphs folder will be created in the main folder, containing the following graphs:

<i>
real.png <br/>
noiseAV_rate.png <br/> 
noiseqrs.png <br/>
noisest.png <br/>
noiseaxis.png  <br/>
noiseqt.png  <br/>
noiserandom30.png  <br/>
noiset.png <br/>
noisep.png  <br/>
noiser.png  <br/>
noiserandom50.png <br/>
noisepr.png  <br/>
noiserandom.png  <br/>
noiserhythm.png <br/>
noiseq.png   <br/>
noises.png <br/>
</i>
<br/>
The <i>real.png</i> file represents the plot for the original ECG and all the other ones represents how the ECG looks
with each noise applied.

<h4> Results </h4>
